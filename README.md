# CS6015_Team_Void

This is a final team project for CS6015 finished within the span of **3 days**. My job in this project is using ***Firebase authentication, storage and realtime database*** tools. I use an authentication tool for authorizing account login and sign up; storage for storing player profile pictures; a realtime database for storing all the player data such as score, username, first name, last name, picture url in storage and birthday.
